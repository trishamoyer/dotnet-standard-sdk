        /// Analyze general tone. Use the general purpose endpoint to analyze the tone of your input content. The service analyzes the content for emotional and language tones. The method always analyzes the tone of the full document; by default, it also analyzes the tone of each individual sentence of the content.   You can submit no more than 128 KB of total input content and no more than 1000 individual sentences in JSON, plain text, or HTML format. The service analyzes the first 1000 sentences for document-level analysis and only the first 100 sentences for sentence-level analysis.   Per the JSON specification, the default character encoding for JSON content is effectively always UTF-8; per the HTTP specification, the default encoding for plain text and HTML is ISO-8859-1 (effectively, the ASCII character set). When specifying a content type of plain text or HTML, include the `charset` parameter to indicate the character encoding of the input text; for example: `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8`. For `text/html`, the service removes HTML tags and analyzes only the textual content.

You can specify one or more of the valid values. Omit the parameter to request results for all three tones. (optional)</param>
        /// <param name="contentLanguage">The language of the input text for the request: English or French. Regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. The input content must match the specified language. Do not submit content that contains both languages. You can specify any combination of languages for `contentLanguage` and `Accept-Language`. * **`2017-09-21`:** Accepts `en` or `fr`. * **`2016-05-19`:** Accepts only `en`. (optional, default to en)</param>

For each utterance of a conversation, the method reports the most prevalent subset of the following seven tones: sad, frustrated, satisfied, excited, polite, impolite, and sympathetic.   If you submit more than 50 utterances, the service returns a warning for the overall content and analyzes only the first 50 utterances. If you submit a single utterance that contains more than 500 characters, the service returns an error for that utterance and does not analyze the utterance. The request fails if all utterances have more than 500 characters.   Per the JSON specification, the default character encoding for JSON content is effectively always UTF-8.
